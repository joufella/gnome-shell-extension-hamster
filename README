Welcome
=======
This is a gnome-shell extension to make your life with the Hamster Time
Tracker easier. Currently it simply uses the hamster-cli tool so this is
very basic.

How to test it
==============
- Make sure hamster is installed.
- mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
- cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
- git clone git://github.com/joufella/gnome-shell-extension-hamster.git \
   hamster@oufella.com
- reload gnome-shell (Alt-F2 r)

User settings
=============
GConf keys:
- /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_12
  Currently used to store the keyboard shortcut that will trigger entering
  an activity when the support for that feature is complete.
  Example:
  key='/apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_12'
  gconftool-2 -s --type string "$key" '<Alt>F3'

Tested platforms
================
- Fedora 15 (gnome-shell 3.0.2)

License
=======
See the COPYING file.

History
=======
- Version 11.7.4 - Display activity, global keybinding, big cleanup.
- Version 11.7.2 - Initial version, basic, uses the hamster-cli tool.

Features Backlog

- More i18n
- DBus interface (as in the Presentation Mode extension)

Cheers
