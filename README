This is a gnome-shell extension to make your life with the Hamster Time
Tracker easier.

How to test it

0. Make sure hamster is installed.
1. mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
2. cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
3. git clone git://github.com/joufella/gnome-shell-extension-hamster.git \
   hamster@oufella.com
4. reload gnome-shell (Alt-F2 r)

Currently it simply uses the hamster-cli tool so this is very basic.
DBus support will be helpful.

Cheers
Jerome Oufella
