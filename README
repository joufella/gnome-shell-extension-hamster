This is a gnome-shell extension to make your life with the Hamster Time
Tracker easier.

How to test it:

- Make sure hamster is installed.
- mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
- cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
- git clone git://github.com/joufella/gnome-shell-extension-hamster.git \
   hamster@oufella.com
- reload gnome-shell (Alt-F2 r)

Currently it simply uses the hamster-cli tool so this is very basic.
DBus support will be helpful.

Tested platforms:
- Fedora 15 (gnome-shell 3.0.2)

License: See the COPYING file.

History:
- Version 11.7.2 - Initial version, basic, uses the hamster-cli tool.

Backlog:
- More i18n
- Global keyboard shortcut to activate
- DBus interface (as in the Presentation Mode extension)
- Display current task info next to icon
- Auto-completion in the text entry field
- Some preferences

Cheers
Jerome Oufella
